* **What is Anagrams?**
    - An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word, or a phrase.
    - The original word or phrase is known as the subject of the anagram.
    - Any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram.
    - ex: Elon Musk -> Muskmelon
