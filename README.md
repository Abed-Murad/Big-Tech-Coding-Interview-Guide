# My Coding Interview Guide

> ![Coding at the whiteboard - from HBO's Silicon Valley](https://d3j2pkmjtin6ou.cloudfront.net/coding-at-the-whiteboard-silicon-valley.png)
>
> I started this repo as place to put all [my Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/abdallahMurad/) solutions alongside with
> their time and space complexity and other notes in one place,
> then it grew to become more of a study plan, and a coding interview guide.
>
> The goal of this guide is to prepare me for the coding interviews in high tech companies like Amazon, Facebook,
> Google, and Microsoft.
>
> This is a personal repo that you may see my notes all over the place, you may find some weird commit messages.
>
> If I had the time in the future I will make sure organize it more!
>
> Good luck :)
