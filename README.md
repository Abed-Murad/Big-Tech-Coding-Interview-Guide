# My Coding Interview Guide

> ![Coding at the whiteboard - from HBO's Silicon Valley](https://d3j2pkmjtin6ou.cloudfront.net/coding-at-the-whiteboard-silicon-valley.png)
>
> I started this repo as place to put all [my Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/abdallahMurad/) solutions alongside with
> their time and space complexity and other notes in one place,
> then it grew to become more of a study plan, and a coding interview guide.
>
> The goal of this guide is to prepare me for the coding interviews in high tech companies like Amazon, Facebook,
> Google, and Microsoft.
>
> This is a personal repo that you may see my notes all over the place, you may find some weird commit messages.
>
> If I had the time in the future I will make sure organize it more!
>
> Good luck :)

## Notes

- Make sure to be familiar with the great algorithms before you start to solve problems this will help you to get more
  of the problems rather than using them the learn the algorithms

- Make sure to be familiar with Graph and Graph Theory before going to Lee Algorithm and shortest path problems

- Use [the Algorithm Design Canvas](https://www.hiredintech.com/classrooms/algorithm-design/lesson/78)
  ![](https://www.hiredintech.com/the-algorithm-design-canvas.png)

- Sliding Window is mostly used with longest [SubSequence, SubArray, SubString]

- When dealing with arrays ,there are a handful of strategies we find useful:
    1. Using pointers
    2. Sorting the array
    3. Using some external data source( like a HashMap)
