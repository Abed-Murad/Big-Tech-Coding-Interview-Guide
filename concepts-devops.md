* **What is DevOps toolchain?**

    - Coding: code development and review, source code management tools, code merging.
    - Building: continuous integration tools, build status.
    - Testing: continuous testing tools.
    - Packaging: application pre-deployment staging.
    - Releasing: release approvals, release automation.
    - Configuring: infrastructure configuration and management.

        - Master: where the most recently released code that in the users hands lives.
        - Feature: where developers work on different features then merge into develop a branch.
